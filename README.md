# Mobile Project by Kadioglu Onur Can


## Introduction

This is a project given to us by our Mobile programming teacher.
We needed to finish this project in 2-3 months after it was given.
In this project we use CLean Architecture and MVVM pattern in Android Studio
Also we have a database in which we can crate or get our user and password 
And I made something not 100% finished but modifiable that it can give any Github users an idea on how to continue my project

## What we need for this project

- We need to install Android Studio
- We need to find a good API that we can follow 


## Instructions to respect

- Clean Architecture & MVVM
- REST
- Displaying an element of the list
- RecycleView Display
- Screens : 4 activities, 1 fragment
<br />
<br />
